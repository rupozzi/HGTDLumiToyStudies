# HGTDLumiToyStudies
Boilerplate for toy simulation studies of luminosity measurements with the HGTD detector at the ATLAS experiment

You can find the main MC simulation in the file [HGTD_ToyMC_Simulation.ipynb](https://github.com/rupozzi/HGTDLumiToyStudies/blob/master/HGTD_ToyMC_Simulation.ipynb).

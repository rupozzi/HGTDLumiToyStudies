# HGTDLumiToyStudies
Boilerplate for toy simulation studies of luminosity measurements with the HGTD detector at the ATLAS experiment

# How to use this
This repository contains a starting point for how to use the `ROOT` library from `python` in a jupyter notebook. There are two main options for doing this:
* install jupyter notebook directly on your own computer
* use it from a docker container

For the latter option, install docker and put this in your terminal:

```
docker run -v /Users/cohm/Desktop/tmp/HGTDLumiToyStudies/:/work -p 3000:8080 cohm/pyroot-notebook:latest
```

This will start the docker image `cohm/pyroot-notebook` which contains a jupyter notebook server, and make the path after the `-v` switch (which could e.g. be the path to where you checked out this repository) accessible from inside the notebooks. When starting this image you should get output like this in your terminal:

```
OhmBookPro13:~/Desktop/tmp > docker run -v /Users/cohm/Desktop/tmp/HGTDLumiToyStudies/:/work -p 3000:8080 cohm/pyroot-notebook:updates-and-removed-workarounds

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-1-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://f4a437845500:8080/?token=2b9ef203e4805fce2baf10e4022a01388336c0c90ddec870

```

If you then open the link `http://127.0.0.1:3000/?token=2b9ef203e4805fce2baf10e4022a01388336c0c90ddec870` in a browser on your laptop, you can start coding. 

(NB! The port number 8080 in the terminal print-out is changed to 3000 here)
